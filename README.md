# Undergraduate-Project-II

The second final year project addressed a NP-hard problem, which was the minimization of the
radius of a circular container to pack a given number of identical unitary radius circles without
having overlapping regions between them. Exact methods can solve it but they may take hours
to solve instances with thirty to fifty circles. Thus, the objective was to develop an effective
bio-inspired heuristic that gives “good” results. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
heuristic takes few seconds to solve each instance with solutions up to 4% worse than an exact
method, in most cases.
